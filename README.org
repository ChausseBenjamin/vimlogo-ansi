* VimLogo - ANSI

#+HTML: </div>

  This is a small terminal program that prints the Vim logo in using ANSI escape codes.
  It utilizes the fact that terminal fonts have a heightxwith ratio of 2x1 combined with
  the ~â–€~ character that covers the top half of a character.

  Since terminals can set a different foreground and background color for each character,
  we can essentially draw 2 vertically stacked pixels per character.

  This is where ANSI escape codes come in. If your terminal supports 24-bit colors, you can
  set foregrounds and background to any rgb value:

  - ~\033[38;2;22;33;44m~ sets the foreground color to rgb(22, 33, 44)
  - ~\033[48;2;44;55;66m~ sets the background color to rgb(44, 55, 66)

  [[https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797#file-ansi-md][This github gist]] was an invaluable resource for gaining a deeper
  understanding of ANSI escape codes and how to use them to draw graphics in
  the terminal. I highly recommend checking it out if you're interested in
  learning more about this topic.

** So why the Vim logo?

   Well, the idea to do this came to me as I was browsing the vim subreddit
   (as one does) and saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1e5o998/if_were_sharing_vim_pixel_art][this post]] by ~u/fapperruning~ where he drew
   the vim logo with pixel art. The size was small enough it could nicely fit
   in a terminal window, though big enough it waas no feasible to draw by hand.

   So using this as a starting point, I searched for a way to firstly parse the image
   and found [[https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite][Piskel]]. The amazing thing about Piskel is that it allows you to export
   a sprite as a big integer array written in C. The first thing I did was to
   downscale ~u/fapperruning~'s image so that 1 pixel = 1 square in the sprite.
   I the slightly modified Piskel's C file output so that it corresponds to a Go slice
   of 32-bit unsigned integers.


   So if you want, this code really doesn't have to be about the Vim logo. Just give it
   any slice of 32-bit integers (as well as the width and height of the image) and it will
   spit it out on your glorious terminal.

   *Note*: Your terminal must be able to display [[https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797#rgb-colors][true colors]] if you want to try/use this.

** How to build

   First, you must have Go installed (duh)...

   Once that's done, just clone the repo, ~cd~ into it and run:

   #+begin_src sh
   go build -o vimlogo-ansi *.go
   #+end_src
